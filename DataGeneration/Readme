1. Descriptions:
    main.py -- main program for SMT solver, the results are saved in directory 'results'
    TF.py   -- class for traffic flow which is used by main.py to organize the information of traffic flows
    meta_configuration.py   -- when generating samples, this file would provide basic setting information
    tf_configurations_generating.py --  generate settings for traffic flows, the results are saved in
                                        directory 'tf_configurations'
    invoke.py   --  invoke main.py with traffic flow settings


2. Basic instruction:
    1) modify 'meta_configuration.py' if needed
    2) execute 'tf_configurations_generating.py' to generate traffic flow settings, each file consists
        of several traffic flows which is used as the input of 'main.py'
    3) execute 'invoke.py' to run the SMT solver automatically
    4) check the results in directory 'results'
