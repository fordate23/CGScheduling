This open-sourced project is for the paper "Resource Optimization with 5G Configured Grant Scheduling for
Real-Time Applications", which contains the main content of the "SMT solution", the heuristic approaches (CoU and Co1)
and the auxiliary function for completing the experimental process such as communication model and application model.

Five models are listed as follows:
    1. DataGeneration:      for the communication & application model
    2. SMTSolution:         for the SMT solution
    3. Heuristic:           for the algorithm "CoU"
    4. NaiveApproach:       for the algorithm "Co1" and the "FCFS" approach
    5. Result analyze:      for generating analyze reports

Prerequisites:
    1. Z3 solver with Python, using "z3-solver" package
    2. Numpy package

How to get started?
    1. Use the scripts "application_parameter.py" and "test_data_generation.py" in "DataGeneration" to generate data samples
    2. Invoke SMT/Heuristic approaches with the scripts "invoke.py"
    3. Use the scripts in "ResultAnalyze" to analyze the results
